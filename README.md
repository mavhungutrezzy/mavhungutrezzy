👋 Hey there! I'm a software developer with a passion for crafting sleek and efficient web applications. My current focus is on Flutter for creating user-friendly interfaces and Python for robust backend development.

🛠️ I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code that adheres to RESTful design principles and seamlessly integrates with databases. Here's a glimpse of my skills:

- 🔨 **Frontend**: Flutter, Angular
- 🔧 **Backend**: Python, Flask, Django
- 🗄️ **Databases**: SQL, Postgres, MongoDB
- 🐳 **Containerization**: Docker
- 📝 **API Design**: OpenAPI 3, Insomnia

💼 My expertise spans various technologies, and I specialize in Flask for backend web development and database management. If you have a specific tech stack in mind, feel free to ask!

🌱 When I'm not coding, you might find me tending to my garden or getting lost in the great outdoors, connecting with the environment.
