## ðŸ’­ About
As an experienced software developer, I am passionate about creating elegant and maintainable code across full-stack web development, big data, and machine learning domains. With a keen interest in staying abreast of the latest tools and trends, I'm excited to learn and work on interesting projects that push the boundaries of what's possible.

In terms of practical experience, I've honed my skills in Python, utilizing frameworks such as Django and Flask to develop full-stack web solutions. My proficiency extends to developing REST APIs using Django Rest Framework, which has enabled me to create efficient and scalable web applications.

Moreover, I have extensive experience working with FastAPI, a cutting-edge framework that facilitates the rapid development of high-performance web APIs using Python. I am also adept at working with databases, including MongoDB and Postgres, both of which play a critical role in the development of robust web applications.

Overall, I'm a self-motivated individual who excels at working independently, but I also thrive as part of a team. If you're looking for someone who is passionate about crafting elegant solutions to complex problems, and can deliver exceptional results on time and on budget, then I'm the developer for you.
